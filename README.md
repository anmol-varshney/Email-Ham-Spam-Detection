# ðŸ˜Ž Detecting Email either as HAM or SPAM Using Naive-Bayes Classifier

The spam detection from the real-world emails has been done using Naive-Bayes classifier. The EDA has been performed along with the preprocessing using TF-IDF vectorizer to convert email text into machine understandable vectors. The model has achieved 85% accuracy.
#### About Dataset

The e-mail dataset contains two different folders, containing text files having some message written in it, named as 'ham' and 'spam' describing the categories of e-mail to be classified.
